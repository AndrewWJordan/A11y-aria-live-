# A11y - aria-live
This app's purpose is to help developers develop an understanding of how dynamic content impacts users of assistive technology and how `aria-live` can increase communication in regard to loading states and content changes. 

You will need to enable a screen reader to utilize this app properly. Please keep in mind, that just like people, screen readers are not created equal and may have different results/responses to these examples. 

I have built and run these examples using VoiceOver. If you are using a different assistive technology, please reach out and share your findings. Please create a well documented issue that includes steps to reproduce if you discover any problems or errors in the code.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
